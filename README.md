# Zip Explorer

Display the content of a Zip/JAR/EPUB/LPF file in a Tree Explorer

## Install

> You can manually install a VS Code extension packaged in a `.vsix` file. Using the Install from VSIX… command in the Extensions view command drop-down, or the Extensions: Install from VSIX… command in the Command Palette, point to the `.vsix` file.

[See VS Code docs for further details](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

## Package

Make sure you have Node.js installed. 

If you don’t have `vsce` already installed, then run:

```
npm install -g vsce
```

`vsce` is the command line tool you'll use to publish extensions for VS Code.

Finally run:

```
vsce package
```

from the root of the directory. This will package your extension into a `.vsix` file.

[See VS Code docs for further details](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/publish-extension).
